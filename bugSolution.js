The solution is to move any code that depends on `this.props` or `this.state` to the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method.  This method is called after the component has successfully rendered.

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log(this.props.someProp); // This will work now!
  }
  render() {
    return <Text>Hello</Text>;
  }
}
```
By making this change, you ensure that `this.props` and `this.state` have been properly initialized before they are used.
